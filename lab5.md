   registered user account, locate registered user location, post and comment, view contents, contact the admin, and
   send feedback.
   
   Administrator can add features, edit the product, delete registered user account, post and comment, and view
   contents.
   
   Visitor can contact the admin, register, and view contents.

Draw a wireframe mockup of your views (either using any online editor, MS Visio, paint or simply by hand with pen an paper + scan) and push them to your github project.
Describe the state transitions between the views, what views you can access from a view, and the opposite, what views lead to a specific view?
