####(Introduction)
+ The project is GParted.

+ Description: GParted is a graphical partition editor for creating, reorganizing, and deleting disk partitions. Its a Linux-based application. (its a clear description)

+ Four types of users:
       1. Casual Users who may want to partition a hard drive, move or resize their partitions, clone or delete, etc.
       2. Developers who are interested in making the application better.
       3. Testers who use the beta versions of the product and test it in many ways for bugs and errors.
       4. Documentation writers who can use this document to assist them in documenting the programâ€™s functions and features.

+ The situation is that GParted is developed on x86 based computers using GNU/Linux. It can be used on other operating systems, such as Windows or Mac OS X, by booting from media containing GParted Live.

+ one of the motivations is that there are several types of such a software, but the aim of this software is to keep it as simple as possible.

5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements 
5.1 Performance Requirements 
5.2 Safety Requirements 
5.3 Security Requirements 

+ The introduction part in the documentation we got is a bit bigger than the one in the template. Moreover, In the document, they splitted out the System Features from the Overall Description, unlike the template where the Features are included under the Overall Description. Furthermore, They used two new headings for the External and other requirements in the documentation, while in the template all the requirements were included under a main heading called Specific Requirements.


####(Use cases)
+ It will create partition tables, enable and disable partition flags, and perform actions such as create, resize, check, copy and paste. Up to that, the application will support file systems such as linux-swap and NTFS, and support other hardwares and softwares.

+ No use case diagram.
 
+ There aren't that much details about the use cases. No diagrams, instead they used several point to describe rapidly the use cases which they called User CLasses.


####(General structure of the system)
+ There are no chart techniques used at all.


####(Functional & non-functional requirements)
+ Yes, listed.

+ Yes, everything is implemented.


####(How does (will) it look?)
+ There are examples for how the application looks like.

+ There are screenshots from the application itself after implementation.

+ There are good explanations about each screenshot which gives quite enough transitions between the screenshots.


####(Process model?)
+ We couldn't find any thing related to process model nor project plan.


####(Your point of view)
+ It has a good part and a bad part. The good part in it that it follows the documentaion standard structures, and the bad part is that is doesn't have any diagrams or charts.

+ No diagrams as we netioned before.

+ The information was quite enough to understand the basic structure and functionality of the application, and with the simplicity of it, we think that such an application is easy to be implemented through this document.
