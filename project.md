####Main page

When you download SUPERTRIO and enter it, a main page full of several features will stop you. The main page insists
on a main navigation part where you can press Sign in to be taken to the signing in page, or Sign up to be taken
to the signing up form. The rest of the main page has the logo of the app, and several links for some recommended profiles where you can press on them and check these profiles without any ability for posting or commenting if you
are not a user.
