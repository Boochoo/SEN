**The Super Trio** indoor positioning is as its name an application that helps a user to get the direction  in the school premises and provides the best way to get the user into his or destination. Positioning can be used to track where the person, who is assigned to do community service by attaching a tracking device in their body parts but that acquires GPS and the indoor positioning only works by using WiFi because of its weakness to detect large geographical locations as in the GPS devices does. And **Super Trio** can be used to control students in a detention room in a high school or elementary if not higher educational institution. 

The global positioning system has been used in most area of fields and locations but where the GPS can't reach, we need to use IPS because walls and roofs shields back the satellite signals which GPS relies on and that makes IPS the one and only option to gather and utilize information about a certain  premises.

Our first priority is to take the invasion of privacy risks into hands by only letting  trusted users in by using different methods of risk eliminators such as setting the WiFi set up so that guests can only use the WiFi of the school. The other one is protecting the profile of the user so that it can not be used otherwise by intruders.

How it works and what is needed :-
+ A compatible smart phone
+ WiFi connection 
+ Simple skill of computing 
+ Some information of the the destination or the person the user is looking for
